This is a **fully functional web-based calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The calculator allows users to perform **basic arithmetic operations** including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculations, and decimal operations. It features a clean and interactive interface with responsive button interactions.

## Features

* **Additional Functionalities:**

  * Clear (`C`) button to reset the screen
  * Backspace (`⟵`) to remove the last input
  * Percentage (`%`) calculation
  * Decimal (`.`) support
* **Interactive UI:** Buttons provide visual feedback when pressed
* **Real-time Display:** Shows input and results dynamically

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – For structuring the calculator
* **CSS3** – For styling, layout, and button animations
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – For handling user input and calculations

## How It Works

1. Users click numeric buttons to input numbers.
2. Operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) are used for calculations.
3. The `=` button evaluates the expression using JavaScript’s `eval()` function.
4. The `C` button clears the screen, and the `⟵` button deletes the last entered character.
5. If an invalid operation is attempted, an **Error** message is displayed.
